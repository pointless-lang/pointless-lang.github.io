### Writing:

## Science vs Engineering vs Design

<pre>- Avery N. Nortonsmith</pre>

-----

Science, Engineering, and Design

hook, cross, jab
vocabulary changes way we think about things

When I was in school, these
terms thrown aronud a lot
what do they really mean?

see patterns in ways of thinking
understand problems I'm solving

-----

science: "Is it true?"

easiest to define, scientific method
form and test a hypothesis

using software, testing methods
coming up with predictions, simple cases

-----

engineering: "How can we solve it?"

satisfy a set of constraints

iterable constant time prepend
persistent

iterable constant time prepend
constant time concatenation

poorly defined
some things called engineering fall under design

-----

design: "Is it the best it can be?"

multiple solutions for a problem
which version is better
which properties do we care about more?

haskell list concatenation
pointless list concatenation

python whitespace with, decorators
