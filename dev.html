<h4>Future features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Update online Pointless environment to support all language features</li>
  <p>Add support for user input, imports</p>

  <li>
    Add readline support for the repl
  </li>

  <li>
    Write a self-hosting parser
  </li>

  <li>
    Implement syntax for shadowing names in object definitions:
  </li>

  <p>
    <div class="sample" style="margin: 0px;">
      <pre class="highlight">
makePoint(x, y) =
  Point {x = capture x; y = capture y}
</pre>
    </div>
  </p>

  <li>
    Provide pre-compiled binaries for different platforms
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Remaining technical issues:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Interpreter is slow</li>
  <p>How can Pointless be more efficiently implemented without losing high-level features?</p>

  <li>IO interface is limited</li>
  <p>Currently can only read from / write to stdin / stdout</p>

  <li>Repl lacks readline support</li>
  <p>(although using <a href="https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap">rlwrap</a> works well for now)</p>
</ul>
